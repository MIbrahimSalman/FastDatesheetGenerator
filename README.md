# Fast Datesheet Generator

A Python tool that simplifies exam schedule management by generating datesheets in a structured array format.

## Overview

Fast Datesheet Generator automates the creation of exam datesheets by converting raw schedule data into a well-organized Python array in the `datesheet_data.py` file. This structured approach makes schedule data easier to access, manipulate, and integrate with other systems.

## Features

- Converts raw schedule information into a standardized array format
- Stores data in an easily importable Python file
- Simplifies schedule management and integration with other systems
- Reduces errors associated with manual data entry
- Provides a consistent data structure for exam schedules

## Usage

1. Input your raw schedule data
2. Run the generator
3. Access the formatted data from `datesheet_data.py`

## Data Structure

The generator creates a structured array in the following format:

```python
datesheet_data = [
   {"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "time": "HH:MM", "subject": "Subject Name", "venue": "Exam Hall"},
   # Additional entries...
]
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures data follows a standardized format
- **Accessibility**: Makes schedule information easily accessible in your Python projects
- **Maintainability**: Centralizes schedule data in a single, well-structured file
- **Integration**: Simplifies integration with web applications, notification systems, and other tools
